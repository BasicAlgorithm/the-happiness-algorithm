# the-happiness-algorithm

This is an attempt to program an algorithm to tell you how happy you are according to the science of happiness. Remember that happiness is not a final and permanent state that you achieve once and voil√†! but a state that you have to maintain. Then, it is probably that you want to run this code from time to time. You are always welcome and maybe with some improvements.
